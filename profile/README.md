## Howdy! We're Belter Labs. ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re a web3 dev crew obsessed with blending 3d, AI, and blockchain into badass, usable products. Our mission? Forge fresh crypto-economic models for the AI age, push the boundaries of 3d tech (we've done some fun stuff with AR, and even built hardware prototypes), and set up creatorsâ€”like artists and developersâ€”to thrive with AI in ways that keep their work theirs and the rewards flowing their way, not to some faceless giant. 

Weâ€™re cooking up something big to level the playing field.

### Our Projects  
- [**Holoframe**](https://www.holoframe.io/) â€“ Augmented reality platform for NFT collections.  
- [**Augment**](https://tryaugment.io/) â€“ Web3-powered 3d marketplace empowering artists and developers in the AI era.
